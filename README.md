## Setup

### Prerequisites

Please follow the steps in [Getting started](https://docs.corbado.com/overview/getting-started) to create and configure
a project in the [Corbado developer panel](https://app.corbado.com/).

You need to have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and `pip` installed to run it.

### Configure environment variables

Use the values you obtained in [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) to configure the following variables inside a `.env`
file you create in the root folder of this project:

```sh
CORBADO_PROJECT_ID=pro-XXX
CORBADO_API_SECRET=corbado1_XXX
CORBADO_FRONTEND_API=https://${CORBADO_PROJECT_ID}.frontendapi.cloud.corbado.io
CORBADO_BACKEND_API=https://backendapi.cloud.corbado.io
```

## Usage

### Run the project locally

Run

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

to create a virtual environment.

Then, activate the virtual environment with

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

or

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

on Windows.

To install all dependencies, run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Migrate your database by running 
    
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```


Now you can start the server by running 

```bash
python manage.py runserver 3000
```
